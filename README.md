## minerva's servant

api for [minerva's akasha](https://github.com/jpegzilla/minervas-akasha)

### api

this api is actually a fully-functioning simple http server written in ruby. I may come back and modularize it a little bit better, so that I can create my own server framework (like javascript's express) in ruby.

### running

requires ruby.

to run the server, just run `rake start`. dependencies will be installed if necessary.

to run in development mode, with more logging and hot reloading, run `rake dev`.

### usage

requires mongodb / ruby / minerva's akasha

// todo...I guess I'll explain here how to set up your own minerva's akasha instance or something...when minerva's akasha reaches alpha LOL
